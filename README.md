# Pixel-Pets

## Summary

Pixel-Pets is a free web game inspired by Tamagotchis, the viral toy of the 1990s. Once your pet hatches, you need to feed it and clean up after it to prevent it from dying. When it's not eating, pooping, or sleeping, you can give it pets and enjoy its appreciation! Like the original toy, you have to use only left or right toggles with a center button once you've selected the action you want to take.
